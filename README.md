# Convert a BOM and NET list into an Eagle schema

This is a modest start for a couple of Eagle ULP scripts that are able
to convert a BOM (with part locations) and a NETS list into an Eagle
schema.

At this writing, this is highly specific for the first Ell-i prototype
board.  However, this works, the structure is there, and over the long
run this may well turn into a more generic tool.  

Feel free to fork, create your own version, and send push requests.
We'll try to be responsive.
