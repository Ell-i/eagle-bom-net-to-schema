Pseudo-code algorithm for reading in schematics to Eagle

For each part


Get part<reference,value,size,x,y,rot,sheet,type> from BOM
Get library_symbol<type,gates,package> from Library
Get library_package<package,smds> from LIbrary

Output "add part<name>@library 'part<reference>' gate<name> part<rot> (r part<x> port<y>)"
Output "value 'part<reference>' 'part<value>'"

Compute and store coordinates for the pins

Get net<net,reference,pin> from NET 

For each net
  Compute the middle point of the net
  Draw lines from middle point to the pins
